## About the Paper

**M3Retrieve: Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval for Medicine** introduces the first large-scale benchmark tailored for multimodal medical retrieval.

- 🚀 **First Multimodal Medical Retrieval Benchmark** – Presents *M3Retrieve*, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates text–image retrieval models in the medical domain.  
- 📚 **Comprehensive Dataset** – Aggregates 22 curated datasets (all under permissive licenses), spanning **16 medical disciplines**, with **1.2M+ text documents** and **164K multimodal queries** covering real-world clinical use cases.  
- 🏥 **Clinically-Grounded Tasks** – Defines five tasks aligned with routine healthcare workflows: Visual Context Retrieval, Multimodal Query-to-Image Retrieval, Case Study Retrieval, and Multimodal Summarisation Retrieval.  
- 📊 **Systematic Evaluation** – Benchmarks a wide range of state-of-the-art uni-modal and multimodal retrieval models, revealing discipline-specific challenges and quantifying retrieval effectiveness.  
- 🌐 **Advancing Medical AI** – Provides a standardized platform to drive innovation in multimodal retrieval systems for healthcare, fostering more reliable and clinically applicable AI models.
