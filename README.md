## About the Paper

**M3Retrieve: Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval for Medicine** introduces the first large-scale benchmark tailored for multimodal medical retrieval.

- 🚀 **First Multimodal Medical Retrieval Benchmark** – Presents *M3Retrieve*, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates text–image retrieval models in the medical domain.  
- 📚 **Comprehensive Dataset** – Aggregates 22 curated datasets (all under permissive licenses), spanning **16 medical disciplines**, with **1.2M+ text documents** and **164K multimodal queries** covering real-world clinical use cases.  
- 🏥 **Clinically-Grounded Tasks** – Defines five tasks aligned with routine healthcare workflows: Visual Context Retrieval, Multimodal Query-to-Image Retrieval, Case Study Retrieval, and Multimodal Summarisation Retrieval.  
- 📊 **Systematic Evaluation** – Benchmarks a wide range of state-of-the-art uni-modal and multimodal retrieval models, revealing discipline-specific challenges and quantifying retrieval effectiveness.  
- 🌐 **Advancing Medical AI** – Provides a standardized platform to drive innovation in multimodal retrieval systems for healthcare, fostering more reliable and clinically applicable AI models.  


## Overview of Retrieval Tasks

M3Retrieve defines a set of clinically grounded retrieval tasks that reflect real-world medical information-seeking workflows:

- 🖼️ **Visual Context Retrieval** – Given an image and short text (e.g., caption), retrieve the most relevant passage from a large medical corpus.  
- 📑 **Multimodal Summary Retrieval** – From a multimodal query (text + image), retrieve the most appropriate expert-written summary that integrates both modalities.  
- 🧾 **Case Study Retrieval** – Match a multimodal clinical query (patient transcript + image) with the most relevant full case study from medical literature.  
- 🩻 **Multimodal Query-to-Image Retrieval** – Retrieve the most relevant medical image (e.g., X-ray, MRI, pathology slide) based on a multimodal query (text + image).  
- ✅ **Quality-Controlled Curation** – All tasks were curated with medical expert guidance and validated through domain-expert reviews to ensure clinical accuracy and relevance.
